**An open-source, multi-agent-based smart customer service system, initially designed for the airport sector but easily adaptable to any industry.**

## 📝 Project Overview

This Smart Customer Service System is an intelligent Q&A system built on **LangGraph**. Initially designed for airport scenarios, its modular and extensible architecture allows for easy migration to various other industries.

The system uses a **Multi-Agent collaborative architecture**. It intelligently routes user requests to different sub-agents via an intent classifier, allowing expert agents to handle specific queries with precision.

Currently, the system provides four main categories of services:
1.  **Travel Procedure Q&A**: Covers the entire process from security checks, customs, ticketing, check-in, to baggage claim.
2.  **Real-time Information Queries**: Includes flight status, schedules, and more.
3.  **Online Service Handling**: Supports tasks like baggage storage, flight rescheduling, etc.
4.  **Conversational Chat**: Engages in human-like, multi-turn conversations with contextual understanding.

The system supports multi-turn dialogue, understands user intent from context, and provides accurate, timely information through knowledge base retrieval and database queries.

## 💥 The Dilemma of Modern Customer Service & Our Solutions

In the wave of Large Language Models (LLMs), every industry is trying to upgrade its customer service with AI. However, the path to "true intelligence" is fraught with challenges. Our project is designed to confront and overcome these dilemmas.

### Dilemma 1: The "AGI Illusion" — Unrealistic Expectations
Many non-technical decision-makers, after witnessing the power of general-purpose LLMs, develop an "AGI illusion," expecting customer service AI to be omniscient.
> **Our Solution**: We believe that the desire for "AGI" is fundamentally a demand for a **truly intelligent "domain brain"** capable of solving core business problems, not just a simple chatbot. We address this head-on by aiming to build a **"Domain AGI"**—a system that achieves genuine, evolving intelligence within a vertical domain, fundamentally meeting and exceeding client expectations.

### Dilemma 2: "Old Wine in a New Bottle" — Architectural Inertia
Many "smart customer service" products on the market are merely evolutionary, replacing small models with large ones within the old "Canvas + Rules" architecture. This paradigm fundamentally constrains the potential of LLMs.
> **Our Solution**: We adopt a brand-new architecture centered around **Multi-Agent Collaboration**. By abandoning rigid, canvas-based workflows, we unleash the full potential of LLMs for advanced context understanding, reasoning, and planning, making the system more flexible, intelligent, and maintainable.

### Dilemma 3: The Gravity of Established Paradigms — Business Realities vs. Innovation
The mature business model of "Canvas + Model" creates a strong gravitational pull, discouraging service providers from undertaking a revolutionary architectural shift. This inertia is the biggest obstacle to innovation in the field.
> **Our Solution**: We chose a harder but more rewarding path—**a complete departure from the old paradigm**. We aren't just patching up existing products; we are redefining smart customer service from the ground up with a new agent-based architecture, aiming to deliver 10x the value of traditional systems.

### Dilemma 4: The Lack of a Continuous Operations & Iteration Loop
A smart customer service system is not a one-and-done project. Like any AI model, its performance degrades over time and requires a comprehensive operational framework for long-term success.
> **Our Solution**: Our system comes with a **built-in, comprehensive evaluation and monitoring platform from day one**. Without any extra development, users can access a visual dashboard to track the performance of every single interaction in real-time. This covers end-to-end analysis from technical to business metrics, providing a solid data foundation for continuous iteration and timely human intervention.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is built on LangGraph, employing a graph-based workflow structure for a modular and cohesive design.
![System Architecture Diagram](./images/主架构图.png)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core Frameworks**:
  - **LangGraph**: For building multi-agent collaborative workflows and state management.
  - **LangChain**: Provides foundational components for building LLM applications.
- **Model Services**:
  - **Xinference**: Manages the full lifecycle of models, used for deploying emotion detection, embedding, and local LLMs.
- **Knowledge Base**:
  - **ragflow**: A powerful knowledge base management platform that supports our RAG capabilities. (Requires separate user installation)
- **External Service Integration**:
  - **MCP**: For flexibly integrating third-party services like Amap, 12306, etc.

## ✨ Features

We're not just building a "chatbot"; we're creating an intelligent hub that solves complex business problems. Here's how we stand out from other solutions:

### Core Advantages: What Makes Us Different?

| Aspect | Traditional / General LLM-based Customer Service | ⭐ **Our Smart Customer Service System** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Business Scope** | Limited to static document Q&A (RAG) | **Full-Spectrum Capabilities**:<br/>- Document Q&A (RAG)<br/>- Database Q&A (Text2SQL)<br/>- Business Process Automation (Agents) |
| **Technical Architecture** | Rigid "Canvas + Rules" model | **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:<br/>Uses a cutting-edge, flexible, and scalable agent collaboration model. |
| **Personalization** | One-size-fits-all, no user memory | **Hyper-Personalization**:<br/>- Combination of long, medium, and short-term memory<br/>- Builds independent user profiles |
| **Ecosystem Empowerment** | Isolated internal tool | **Open Empowerment**:<br/>- Can empower third-party apps with user profiles (e.g., for cold-start recommendations)<br/>- Can integrate third-party profiles to enhance service effectiveness |

### Specific Features & Experience

1.  **Proactive Interaction**: When a user's query is ambiguous, the system actively asks clarifying questions, simulating a human-like conversation to guide the user to a more precise answer.
2.  **Intelligent Recommendations & Intent Guidance**: We recognize that user intent can sometimes be unclear. To address this, the system features an **intelligent recommendation module** ("Guess you want to ask," "Guess you want to do," "Guess you want to buy"). When the user's intent isn't fully clear, the system proactively suggests relevant questions, services, or products based on the current conversation and our internal knowledge base. This not only speeds up problem resolution but also significantly improves user experience and increases the system's fault tolerance.
3.  **Closed-Loop Optimization**: The system continuously learns through its powerful memory module, feeding valuable insights back into the knowledge base for self-improvement.
4.  **Multi-language Support**: A built-in multi-language module ensures accurate communication across various languages.
5.  **Security & Compliance**: An integrated security module reviews interactions to ensure all content is safe and appropriate.
6.  **Multimodal Emotion Detection**: The system detects user emotions in real-time to adjust its tone and, if necessary, trigger a handoff to a human agent.
